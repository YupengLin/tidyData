## Method to get the tidy data set

1 Merge two data set

There are two data set the test set and train set. I use the row-bind method to get the whole Set. 

2 Extract the Mean and Std variable

I used the regular expression to find out the index of the mean and standard deviation variable. By the index I can find the subset of the mean and std measurement.
